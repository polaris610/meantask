Hello,
Thanks for your interest, could you please let me know when you can start and how long it will take? Here is the repository you can pull the code:

https://bitbucket.org/nsaquib/itteam.git

you can do “grunt fillData” to have initial data filled. You can take book section as reference for creating CRUD for Journal. There will be 2 Journals, Journal-1 and Journal-2.

Let me know if you have any questions, or share your skypeID if you want to discuss further details.

Thanks,
Najam
